# Portfolio Website

This project contains a small portfolio built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd next-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.

To build the static site for deployment (e.g. on Netlify), run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files will be in the `next-portfolio/out` directory, which can be
deployed as a static site.
