# Portfolio Website

This project contains a small portfolio built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd next-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.
## Usage

Open any of the HTML files in your browser. If you want to serve the site locally, you can use a simple static server, for example with Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
